## Overview

Cotila (**co**mpile-**ti**me **l**inear **a**lgebra) provides a set of linear algebra functions in C++ intended for use during compile time. 
All functions available in Cotila are ***constexpr***, meaning they can be used at compile-time to generate constants and lookup tables in a type-safe, transparent manner.

## Installation

Cotila is a header-only library.  Simply point your compiler to include the `include/` directory.

Code must be compiled with at least C++17 support to use Cotila.

## Documentation

The documentation can be generated by running `make docs`, which requires Doxygen.  It can also be viewed [online](https://calebzulawski.github.io/cotila/).

## Quickstart Guide

To use Cotila, all you need to do is `#include <cotila/cotila.h>`.  This header will include all of the headers provided by Cotila.

The Cotila interface is designed around operations commonly found in BLAS or MATLAB and should be simple and predictable.

### Types

Cotila provides support for three types: **scalars**, **vectors**, and **matrices**.

**Scalars** are represented by fundamental types, such as `float` or `double`, as well as `std::complex`.  Cotila provides a variety of operations that manipulate scalar types.  In some cases, such as square roots, a standard library implementation already exists but it is not `constexpr`.  A simple example below:

```c++
constexpr double s = cotila::sqrt(4.);
static_assert(s == 2.); // this evaluates and passes at compile time
```

**Vectors** are represented by the `cotila::vector` class.  The `vector` class is a container for scalar types.  Additionally, `vector` is an aggregate class containing a single array and is constructed via [aggregate initialization](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization).  If you are confused, some notes on aggregate initialization can be found in the next section.  A simple vector example:
```c++
constexpr cotila::vector<double, 3> v1 {{1., -2., 3.}};
constexpr cotila::vector<double, 3> v2 {{1., 2., 3.}};
static_assert(v2 == cotila::abs(v1));
```

**Matrices** are represented by the `cotila::matrix` class.  Like the `vector` class, `matrix` is an aggregate class containing a single 2-dimensional array.  A `matrix` is initialized like a normal 2-dimensional array in C++ (i.e. row-major order).  A simple matrix example:
```c++
/*  m1 contains:        m2 contains:
 *  1 2 3               1 4
 *  4 5 6               2 5
 *                      3 6
 */
constexpr cotila::matrix<double, 2, 3> m1 {{{1., 2., 3.}, {4., 5., 6.}}};
constexpr cotila::matrix<double, 3, 2> m2 {{{1., 4.}, {2., 5.}, {3., 6.}}};
static_assert(m2 == cotila::transpose(m1));
```

**Complex values** are not handled any differently, other than initialization:
```c++
/*  m1 contains:        m2 contains:
 *  1 + 0i   2 + 1i     1 + 0i   3 + 1i
 *  3 - 1i   4 + 2i     2 - 1i   4 - 2i
 *
 */
constexpr cotila::matrix<std::complex<double>, 2, 2> m1 {{{1., 0.}, {2., 1.}}, {{3., -1.}, {4., 2.}}};
constexpr cotila::matrix<std::complex<double>, 2, 2> m2 {{{1., 0.}, {3., 1.}}, {{2., -1.}, {4., -2.}}};
static_assert(m2 = cotila::hermitian(m1));
```

### Aggregate Initialization

Aggregate objects can be initialized similarly to C structs by simply providing an initializer list with the values to initialize each member.  In C++, arrays can be initialized like so:
```c++
double arr[3] = {1., 2., 3.};
```
or
```c++
double arr[3] {1., 2., 3.};
```
The `cotila::vector` class contains a single array:
```c++
template<typename T, std::size_t N>
struct vector {
    T arr[N];
};
```
To initialize a `vector`, you must initialize the array member, which results in an extra set of braces:
```c++
vector<double, 3> v = {{1., 2., 3.}};
```
or
```c++
vector<double, 3> v {{1., 2., 3.}};
```
